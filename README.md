# ReelMeIn

ReelMeIn is the go-to source for movie lovers, casual viewers, or any couple trying to kick back after putting the kids to bed. ReelMeIn uses The Movie Database API to fetch information about any of an extensive collection of movies, including release date, run time, and more. Users can add movies to their watch lists, mark them as "watched" when the show is over, and search for movies they've previously saved.
